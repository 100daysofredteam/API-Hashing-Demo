# API-Hashing-Demo
This repository contains code for demonstration of API Hashing Technique. 

In API Hashing, unique hashes are created for Windows APIs and these hashes are then used to search for the required Windows APIs from the respective library. This requires a custom method / function which can dynamically resolve the address of a Windows API through a given hash instead of the name. 

This code was created as part of [100 Days of Red Team](https://www.100daysofredteam.com/p/what-is-api-hashing-red-team)
